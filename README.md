# BaseConverter2to36-emu8086
This project aims to develop a versatile base converter implemented in assembly language, capable of converting numbers between bases 2 to 36. The converter will consist of modules for input handling, error checking, and conversion from any base to any base. It will first convert the given base number to decimal and then convert it according to the user's preference.
